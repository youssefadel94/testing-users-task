a simple query selector 

to run open terminal and type 

npm i && npm run server .. this will install node modules and run a mock api using the db.json file 

the db.json file work as a dynamic collection the questions added to the db will reflect in the app 
and query the responses subsequently 

to run the app open another terminal and run 

ng serve .. this will start the app on localhost:4200

due to further implementation of logic needed for query switching you can reset the query selection by coosing the select option from drop down
